# Cache Simulation

This repository contains a Python script implementing FIFO (First-In-First-Out) and LFU (Least Frequently Used) caching algorithms.

## Introduction

Caching is a technique used to store frequently accessed data in a way that allows for faster retrieval. This project simulates two caching algorithms: FIFO and LFU. The script allows users to input a series of page requests and choose an algorithm to see how the cache handles the requests.

## Files

- `cache_simulation.py`: The main Python script that runs the cache simulation.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/cache_simulation.git
